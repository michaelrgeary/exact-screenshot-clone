These apply to ALL agents in the Book Maker system.

## Critical (Must Follow)

- **Roofing terminology**: Always use terms from the glossary. Check before inventing new terms. Consistency across the book is essential.

- **Tone**: This book is for working roofers. Keep language practical and direct. Avoid academic or overly formal phrasing.

- **Insurance context**: Roofing sales often involves insurance claims. This is a key differentiator from other sales contexts. When in doubt, think about how this applies to storm damage and insurance adjusters.

## Important (Should Follow)

- When referencing other chapters, use format: "As we covered in Chapter X..." not "See Chapter X" or "Chapter X discusses..."

- Examples should feel realistic. Real neighborhoods, realistic damage scenarios, believable homeowner concerns.

- The target audience is sales reps at roofing companies, not business owners. Focus on practical scripts and techniques they can use immediately.

## Observations (Context)

- Readers may be reading on phones between appointments. Keep paragraphs short and scannable.

- The roofing industry has a reputation problem ("storm chasers"). Position content to differentiate from disreputable competitors.

- Many roofers work with insurance claims. Adjuster interactions are a key skill area.

## Don't Do

- Don't use car sales examples. Transform them to roofing.
- Don't assume reader has read previous chapters when writing summaries.
- Don't use overly complex diagrams. Simple and clear is better.
- Don't be preachy about ethics. Assume the reader is professional.
