# Learnings: Relationship Mapper

## Best Practices

### Cross-Reference Detection
- Look for explicit chapter references ("as we discussed in Chapter 3")
- Find implicit concept dependencies
- Map where examples could reference each other
- Note where later chapters assume earlier knowledge

### Dependency Types
- Hard dependency: must read Chapter 2 before Chapter 5
- Soft dependency: helpful but not required
- Enhancement opportunity: could add a cross-reference
- Contradiction check: ensure consistency

### Relationship Categories
- Builds upon (foundational → advanced)
- Parallels (same concept, different context)
- Contrasts (alternative approaches)
- Examples of (illustrates a concept from another chapter)

## Do's
- Create a visual dependency graph if complex
- Note bi-directional relationships
- Identify "hub" chapters that connect many others
- Flag circular dependencies

## Don'ts
- Don't create relationships where none exist
- Don't miss obvious connections
- Don't over-connect (not everything relates)
- Don't ignore the author's explicit references
