# Learnings: Fact Checker

## Best Practices

### What to Verify
- Roofing material claims (durability, ratings)
- Price ranges and percentages
- Industry statistics
- Legal/insurance claims
- Historical references

### Verification Levels
- **Critical**: Could cause harm if wrong (safety, legal)
- **Important**: Affects credibility (stats, prices)
- **Minor**: Nice to be accurate (dates, names)
- **Opinion**: Not factual, no check needed

### Common Issues
- Outdated statistics
- Regional variations stated as universal
- Exaggerated claims
- Unverified testimonials

## Do's
- Flag unverifiable claims
- Suggest softening language ("typically" vs. "always")
- Note when facts need updating
- Verify roofing-specific technical claims

## Don'ts
- Don't fact-check opinions or advice
- Don't over-scrutinize common knowledge
- Don't miss safety-critical claims
- Don't change meaning when correcting
