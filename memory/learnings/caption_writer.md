# Learnings: Caption Writer

## Best Practices

### Caption Purpose
- Explain what diagram shows
- Reinforce key takeaway
- Provide context if needed
- Stand alone (make sense without text)

### Caption Format
- "Figure X.Y: [Descriptive Title]"
- One sentence description
- Optional: Key insight or action
- Keep under 25 words

### Style
- Action-oriented when possible
- Match book's voice
- Avoid obvious ("This diagram shows...")
- Add value beyond the visual

## Do's
- Make captions informative
- Include the "so what"
- Number consistently (Figure 3.1, 3.2...)
- Translate well to Spanish

## Don'ts
- Don't just describe what's visible
- Don't make captions too long
- Don't use jargon unexplained elsewhere
- Don't repeat the diagram's text verbatim
