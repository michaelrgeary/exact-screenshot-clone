# Learnings: Diagram Specifier

## Best Practices

### Specification Content
- Diagram type (flowchart, comparison, model)
- All text elements with exact wording
- Visual relationships (arrows, groupings)
- Color suggestions (consistent palette)
- Size/proportion guidance

### Diagram Types
- Flowchart: Decision points, process steps
- Comparison: Side-by-side elements
- Pyramid/Hierarchy: Importance levels
- Cycle: Repeating processes
- Matrix: Two-dimensional relationships

### Rough.js Considerations
- Hand-drawn aesthetic (roughness 1.5-2.5)
- Caveat font for text
- Limited color palette (3-4 colors)
- Simple shapes (rectangles, circles, arrows)

## Do's
- Be extremely specific about text
- Include all visual relationships
- Note what NOT to include
- Specify emphasis (bold, larger, etc.)

## Don'ts
- Don't leave text vague ("something about...")
- Don't over-complicate the diagram
- Don't specify more than 10-12 elements
- Don't forget accessibility (color alone isn't meaning)
