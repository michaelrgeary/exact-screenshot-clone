# Learnings: Quality Scorer

## Best Practices

### Scoring Approach
- Use evidence-based assessment
- Score each dimension independently
- Apply consistent standards
- Document reasoning

### Dimension Focus
- Content Fidelity: Did we preserve the core value?
- Roofing Relevance: Does it feel authentic?
- Clarity: Easy to understand?
- Actionability: Can reader use this?
- Engagement: Interesting to read?
- Flow: Smooth reading experience?
- Visual Integration: Diagrams add value?
- Consistency: Matches book standards?

### Threshold Application
- Overall minimum: 0.80
- Each dimension has its own minimum
- All must pass for chapter to proceed
- Document any close calls

## Do's

- Cite specific examples for scores
- Compare to book average
- Note patterns across chapters

## Don'ts
- Don't inflate scores to pass
- Don't be inconsistent between chapters
- Don't skip dimensions
- Don't miss blocking issues
