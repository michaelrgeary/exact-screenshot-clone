# Learnings: Issue Processor

## Best Practices

### Issue Aggregation
- Collect from all editing agents
- Deduplicate similar issues
- Group by type (grammar, tone, fact, etc.)
- Note which agent flagged each

### Prioritization
- **Critical**: Blocks publication (facts, legal)
- **High**: Significantly affects quality
- **Medium**: Should fix but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice to fix if time permits

### Conflict Resolution
- When agents disagree, note the conflict
- Prefer clarity over style
- Prefer accuracy over flow
- Human review for complex conflicts

## Do's
- Create actionable issue list
- Note severity and location
- Group related issues together
- Estimate effort per issue

## Don'ts
- Don't create duplicate entries
- Don't miss critical issues in noise
- Don't over-prioritize minor issues
- Don't ignore agent disagreements
