# Learnings: Transition Writer

## Best Practices

### Transition Types
- **Bridge**: Connect related ideas smoothly
- **Pivot**: Shift to new but related topic
- **Summary-advance**: Recap before moving on
- **Question hook**: Pose question that next section answers

### Transition Placement
- End of each section (lead into next)
- Between major topic shifts
- Before and after stories
- Into and out of scripts

### Natural Flow
- Transitions should feel invisible
- Reader shouldn't notice the "seams"
- Maintain energy across transitions
- Vary transition styles

## Do's
- Read sections aloud to test flow
- Connect emotionally, not just logically
- Use transitions to reinforce key points
- Make the reader want to continue

## Don'ts
- Don't use formulaic transitions ("Now let's talk about...")
- Don't create jarring topic shifts
- Don't lose momentum at transitions
- Don't over-summarize (reader just read it)
