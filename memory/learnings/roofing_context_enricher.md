# Learnings: Roofing Context Enricher

## Best Practices

### Enrichment Areas
- Add industry-specific details to generic statements
- Include realistic price ranges where appropriate
- Add timeline/seasonal context
- Include crew/operational realities

### Authenticity Checks
- Would a roofer nod along reading this?
- Are the details accurate for the region?
- Do timelines match real roofing operations?
- Are prices in reasonable ranges?

### Details to Add
- Weather considerations (can't roof in rain, etc.)
- Material specifics (brand examples, quality tiers)
- Crew dynamics (when to mention installer skills)
- Permit and inspection processes

## Do's
- Add details that make content more credible
- Include insider knowledge that builds trust
- Reference actual industry practices
- Make the content feel like it's written by a roofer

## Don'ts
- Don't add details that could become outdated
- Don't include prices that are too specific
- Don't over-specify (keep some flexibility)
- Don't add details that distract from the sales lesson
