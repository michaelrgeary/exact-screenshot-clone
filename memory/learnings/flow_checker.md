# Learnings: Flow Checker

## Best Practices

### Flow Elements
- Logical progression of ideas
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Appropriate pacing (not too rushed/slow)
- Clear through-line from start to finish

### Problem Indicators
- Reader would need to re-read
- Abrupt topic changes
- Missing logical connections
- Sections that feel out of order

### Transition Quality
- Each section leads naturally to next
- Callbacks and foreshadowing work
- Energy builds appropriately
- Conclusion feels earned

## Do's
- Read chapter as a whole
- Note where you stumble
- Suggest reordering if needed
- Check story placements make sense

## Don'ts
- Don't suggest changes that break dependencies
- Don't miss pacing issues (too dense/light)
- Don't ignore chapter-to-chapter flow
- Don't over-smooth (some tension is good)
