# Learnings: Chapter Outliner

## Best Practices

### Outline Structure
- Opening hook (story, question, or bold statement)
- 3-5 main sections per chapter
- Each section has clear teaching objective
- Strong close with call to action

### Section Planning
- Balance theory and practice within sections
- Plan where tactics/scripts will appear
- Note where visual opportunities exist
- Include transition points between sections

### Content Flow
- Start with "why" before "how"
- Build complexity gradually
- Place most important content in middle
- End with actionable takeaways

## Do's
- Reference previous chapter summaries when relevant
- Plan where cross-references will appear
- Include estimated word count per section
- Note which tactics from analysis go where

## Don'ts
- Don't plan sections that are too long (>1500 words)
- Don't front-load all the good content
- Don't forget the emotional arc
- Don't create outlines that are too rigid
