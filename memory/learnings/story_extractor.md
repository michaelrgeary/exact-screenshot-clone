# Learnings: Story Extractor

## Best Practices

### Story Identification
- Look for narrative markers ("I remember when...", "One time...", "A client of mine...")
- Case studies often start with a problem statement
- Examples may be embedded mid-paragraph
- Watch for hypothetical scenarios ("Imagine you're...")

### Classification
- Personal anecdote (author's experience)
- Client/customer story
- Third-party case study
- Hypothetical scenario
- Historical reference

### Extraction Quality
- Capture the full story arc (setup, conflict, resolution)
- Note the lesson/moral explicitly
- Record where the story appears (for context)
- Identify what tactic/concept the story illustrates

## Do's
- Keep stories intact (don't fragment)
- Note emotional elements that make stories memorable
- Identify which stories are "signature" (used repeatedly)
- Tag stories by sales stage (prospecting, closing, etc.)

## Don'ts
- Don't confuse examples with full stories
- Don't miss embedded mini-stories
- Don't strip context that makes the story work
- Don't duplicate stories that appear in multiple chapters
