# Learnings: Diagram Placer

## Best Practices

### Placement Rules
- Place diagram after concept is introduced
- Before example that applies the concept
- Near the text it illustrates
- Not in middle of a narrative

### Page Layout
- Consider where page breaks might fall
- Full-width diagrams need clear space
- Inline diagrams need text wrap
- Caption always visible with diagram

### Flow Integration
- Diagram should feel natural, not interrupting
- Reader should know what to look at first
- Clear what diagram is illustrating
- Text can reference "the diagram above/below"

## Do's
- Specify exact placement (after paragraph X)
- Note if diagram should be full-width or inline
- Include reference text ("See Figure 3.1")
- Consider mobile/ebook rendering

## Don'ts
- Don't place mid-story
- Don't separate diagram from relevant text
- Don't place two diagrams back-to-back
- Don't assume page layout is fixed
