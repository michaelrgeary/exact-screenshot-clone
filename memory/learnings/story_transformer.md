# Learnings: Story Transformer

## Best Practices

### Scenario Conversion
- Car salesman story → Roofing sales rep story
- Generic business meeting → Homeowner kitchen table
- Office setting → On the roof / at the front door
- Abstract customer → Specific homeowner persona

### Roofing-Specific Settings
- Storm-chaser situations
- Insurance claim scenarios
- Competitive bid situations
- Repeat customer/referral contexts
- Property manager negotiations

### Emotional Preservation
- Keep the tension/conflict that makes stories work
- Preserve the "aha moment"
- Maintain relatable struggles
- Keep the victory satisfying

## Do's
- Make the protagonist a roofing sales rep
- Use realistic roofing situations
- Include sensory details (on the roof, in the driveway)
- Add weather and seasonal context

## Don'ts
- Don't lose the story's teaching point
- Don't make scenarios unrealistic for roofing
- Don't strip emotional elements
- Don't create stories that are too similar to each other
