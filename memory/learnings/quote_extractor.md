# Learnings: Quote Extractor

## Best Practices

### Quote Identification
- Look for quotation marks (obviously)
- Find emphasized/bold statements that serve as mantras
- Identify chapter or section summaries
- Watch for repeatable phrases readers might remember

### Types of Quotes
- Direct dialogue (from scripts or stories)
- Author's memorable statements
- Third-party quotes (famous people, other authors)
- Customer/prospect sample dialogue

### Quality Criteria
- Is it quotable? (Would someone highlight this?)
- Is it self-contained? (Makes sense without context?)
- Is it memorable? (Rhythm, alliteration, insight?)
- Is it actionable? (Guides behavior?)

## Do's
- Note the context around each quote
- Identify which tactic/concept the quote supports
- Tag quotes by potential use (callout, chapter header, etc.)
- Preserve exact wording

## Don'ts
- Don't extract every piece of dialogue
- Don't miss the book's most powerful statements
- Don't include quotes that require too much context
- Don't attribute incorrectly (author vs. character)
