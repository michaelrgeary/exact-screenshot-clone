# Learnings: Structure Analyzer

## Best Practices

### Theme Identification
- Look for repeated concepts across chapters
- Identify the core methodology/framework
- Note progression (beginner → advanced)
- Find the "big idea" the author is teaching

### Relationship Mapping
- Which chapters build on previous ones?
- Which chapters can stand alone?
- Are there callback references?
- Is there a narrative arc?

### Content Classification
- Theory vs. practical application ratio
- Number of stories/examples per chapter
- Script-heavy vs. concept-heavy chapters
- Visual opportunity density

## Do's
- Create a clear book outline
- Note the target audience explicitly
- Identify the book's unique selling proposition
- Map prerequisite knowledge per chapter

## Don'ts
- Don't assume linear dependency if chapters are independent
- Don't miss implicit themes
- Don't overlook the author's teaching style
- Don't ignore front/back matter themes
