# Learnings: Visual Opportunity Identifier

## Best Practices

### Visual Types to Consider
- Process flowcharts (step-by-step procedures)
- Comparison charts (before/after, good/bad)
- Frameworks/models (conceptual diagrams)
- Checklists (formatted callouts)
- Timeline diagrams

### Opportunity Triggers
- "Here are the steps..."
- "There are three types..."
- "Compare this to that..."
- Complex processes described in text
- Lists that would be clearer visually

### Placement Considerations
- One diagram per major section maximum
- Don't visualize simple concepts
- Place near relevant text
- Consider page layout

## Do's
- Identify where visuals add clarity
- Note what type of diagram fits best
- Consider Rough.js hand-drawn style
- Flag must-have vs. nice-to-have

## Don'ts
- Don't over-visualize (not everything needs a diagram)
- Don't suggest visuals for simple lists
- Don't create visual clutter
- Don't miss obvious opportunities
