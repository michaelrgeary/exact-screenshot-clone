# Learnings: Duplicate Detector

## Best Practices

### Duplicate Types
- **Exact duplicate**: Same content repeated
- **Near duplicate**: Slight variation of same concept
- **Overlapping**: Significant shared content
- **Complementary**: Same topic, different angles (OK)

### Detection Strategies
- Compare tactic descriptions for similarity
- Look for repeated scripts across chapters
- Check for stories told multiple times
- Identify frameworks that overlap

### Resolution Guidance
- Keep the most complete version
- Consolidate into one location
- Create reference to canonical version
- Note intentional repetition (OK to keep)

## Do's
- Flag severity (critical duplicate vs. minor overlap)
- Suggest which version to keep
- Note if repetition is intentional (reinforcement)
- Consider reader experience (is repetition helpful?)

## Don'ts
- Don't flag legitimate variations as duplicates
- Don't miss near-duplicates with different wording
- Don't remove intentional reinforcement
- Don't create orphaned references
