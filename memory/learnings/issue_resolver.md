# Learnings: Issue Resolver

## Best Practices

### Resolution Process
- Work through issues by priority
- Make minimal changes to fix
- Verify fix doesn't create new issues
- Document resolution decisions

### Fix Types
- Direct edit (clear solution)
- Rewrite (section needs significant work)
- Delete (content not needed)
- Flag for human (too complex)

### Quality Preservation
- Don't break what's working
- Test reading flow after fixes
- Ensure fixes are consistent with style
- Verify cross-references still work

## Do's
- Fix root cause, not just symptom
- Check surrounding context
- Verify issue is actually resolved
- Note when human input needed

## Don'ts
- Don't over-fix (minimal changes)
- Don't introduce new issues
- Don't change more than necessary
- Don't skip verification
