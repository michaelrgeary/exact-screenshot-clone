# Learnings: Clarity Editor

## Best Practices

### Clarity Improvements
- Simplify complex sentences
- Break up long paragraphs
- Replace jargon with plain language
- Add transitions where needed

### Readability Targets
- Grade 7-8 reading level
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- One idea per paragraph
- Active voice preferred

### Common Issues
- Passive voice ("was done by" → "did")
- Nominalizations ("make a decision" → "decide")
- Unclear pronouns ("it" without referent)
- Run-on sentences

## Do's
- Read aloud to test clarity
- Preserve author's voice while improving
- Keep the "punch" of impactful statements
- Focus on sections that require re-reading

## Don'ts
- Don't over-simplify expert content
- Don't lose the author's personality
- Don't change meaning while simplifying
- Don't create choppiness with too-short sentences
