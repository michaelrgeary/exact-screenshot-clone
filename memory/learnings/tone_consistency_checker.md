# Learnings: Tone Consistency Checker

## Best Practices

### Tone Elements
- Formality level (casual ↔ professional)
- Energy level (calm ↔ enthusiastic)
- Directness (suggestive ↔ commanding)
- Emotional warmth (neutral ↔ personal)

### Consistency Checks
- Does the chapter match the style guide?
- Are there jarring tone shifts?
- Is the "character" of the book consistent?
- Does advice feel peer-to-peer throughout?

### Common Issues
- Suddenly formal after conversational
- Overly enthusiastic in serious sections
- Condescending tone in practical advice
- Inconsistent use of "you" vs. "we"

## Do's
- Compare to style guide benchmarks
- Note specific passages that drift
- Suggest tone adjustments
- Flag sections that feel "off"

## Don'ts
- Don't make all sections sound identical
- Don't remove intentional emphasis variation
- Don't flatten natural expression
- Don't miss subtle condescension
