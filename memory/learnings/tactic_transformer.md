# Learnings: Tactic Transformer

## Best Practices

### Roofing Context Mapping
- Generic "product" → specific roofing materials (shingles, underlayment, flashing)
- Generic "service" → roofing services (inspection, repair, replacement)
- Generic "customer" → homeowner, property manager, insurance adjuster
- Generic "objections" → roofing-specific concerns (timing, weather, insurance)

### Authenticity Requirements
- Use actual roofing terminology (see GLOSSARY)
- Reference real scenarios (storm damage, aging roof, leak)
- Include realistic price points and timeframes
- Mention actual roofing challenges (weather windows, crew scheduling)

### Preservation Rules
- Keep the core sales psychology intact
- Maintain the tactic's effectiveness
- Don't lose the "why it works" insight
- Preserve the emotional component

## Do's
- Add roofing-specific conditions (when to use)
- Include relevant roofing terminology naturally
- Make examples feel like real roofing situations
- Test: "Would a roofer recognize this?"

## Don'ts
- Don't just find-replace words
- Don't lose the tactic's power
- Don't make it feel forced or artificial
- Don't add inaccurate roofing details
