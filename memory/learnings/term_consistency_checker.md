# Learnings: Term Consistency Checker

## Best Practices

### Consistency Checks
- Same term for same concept throughout
- Glossary terms used as defined
- Abbreviations introduced before use
- Proper nouns spelled consistently

### Common Issues
- Switching between terms (customer/client/homeowner)
- Inconsistent abbreviations (ROI vs. R.O.I.)
- Variations (shingle/shingles when meaning differs)
- Case inconsistency (Roofing vs. roofing)

### Resolution Priority
- Use glossary term if one exists
- Use most common variant in source
- Use most professional-sounding option
- Be consistent with industry standard

## Do's
- Create a term mapping list
- Note intentional variations (OK)
- Check across all chapters
- Verify against GLOSSARY

## Don'ts
- Don't flag stylistic variations as errors
- Don't change terms that are intentionally different
- Don't miss synonyms that should be standardized
- Don't over-standardize natural language
