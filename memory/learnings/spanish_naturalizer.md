# Learnings: Spanish Naturalizer

## Best Practices

### Naturalization Goals
- Sounds like a native wrote it
- No "translated from English" feel
- Flows naturally when read aloud
- Idioms and expressions feel authentic

### Common Issues
- Unnatural word order
- Overly literal phrasing
- Missing Spanish connectors
- Stilted dialogue

### Enhancement Areas
- Add appropriate filler words
- Adjust sentence rhythm
- Use natural Spanish idioms
- Fix "Spanglish" patterns

## Do's
- Read aloud to test naturalness
- Compare to native Spanish writing
- Preserve meaning while improving flow
- Note particularly good adaptations

## Don'ts
- Don't change meaning while naturalizing
- Don't add unnecessary embellishment
- Don't miss awkward phrasing
- Don't over-localize (keep neutral)
