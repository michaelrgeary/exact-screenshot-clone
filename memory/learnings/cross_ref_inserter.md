# Learnings: Cross-Ref Inserter

## Best Practices

### Reference Insertion
- Use natural language, not academic citations
- Place references where they add value
- Don't interrupt story flow
- Reference specific content, not just chapters

### Reference Phrasing
- "Remember the Feel-Felt-Found technique from Chapter 3?"
- "We'll explore objection handling further in Chapter 8"
- "This builds on the trust-building framework..."
- "As the storm-chaser story illustrated..."

### Balance
- 2-5 references per chapter is typical
- Mix forward and backward references
- Don't over-reference early chapters
- References should enhance, not distract

## Do's
- Verify referenced content actually exists
- Make references specific and helpful
- Use references to reinforce key concepts
- Test that references make sense in context

## Don'ts
- Don't reference every related chapter
- Don't break narrative flow
- Don't make reader feel they missed something
- Don't create confusing circular references
