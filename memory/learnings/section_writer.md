# Learnings: Section Writer

Last updated: [Initial Setup]

## Critical (Must Follow)

- **ALWAYS end with a conclusion or transition**: Every section must end with either a clear conclusion sentence OR a transition that bridges to the next topic. Sections that end abruptly will fail validation.

- **Setup context for scripts**: When including a sales script, always provide 2-3 sentences of context explaining WHEN to use this script. The situation matters as much as the words.

## Important (Should Follow)

- Keep sections between 400-800 words. Shorter feels rushed, longer loses attention.

- Use the roofing scenario as the framing device. Start with the situation ("You're on the roof with the homeowner...") then teach the technique.

- Include at least one specific example per section. Abstract advice doesn't stick.

- Query the memory system for relevant tactics: `get_tactics_for_chapter()` and `search_tactics()` will give you material to work with.

## Observations (Context)

- Sections about scripts tend to run longer than sections about mindset. This is fine - scripts need more detail.

- The "feel-felt-found" technique appears frequently in sales books. It's a foundational framework.

- Roofing sales often happens at the homeowner's door or on their property. Set scenes accordingly.

## Don't Do

- Don't just list tactics. Weave them into a narrative.
- Don't end a section mid-thought. Always close the loop.
- Don't start sections with "In this section, we will..." - just dive in.
- Don't use generic business examples. Every example should involve roofs, storms, homeowners, or insurance.
