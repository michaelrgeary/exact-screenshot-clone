# Learnings: Originality Checker

## Best Practices

### What to Check
- New content vs. source content
- Transformation quality (not just copy)
- Unique roofing perspective added
- Original examples and stories

### Originality Metrics
- Significant rewording of concepts
- New examples and stories created
- Roofing context adds unique value
- Voice is distinctly different

### Acceptable Similarity
- Preserved core concepts (intentional)
- Quoted material (attributed)
- Industry-standard terminology
- Universal sales wisdom

## Do's
- Compare to source chapter
- Verify transformation happened
- Note sections that are too similar
- Confirm roofing context is substantive

## Don'ts
- Don't flag intentionally preserved quotes
- Don't require rewording of universal truths
- Don't miss large copied sections
- Don't confuse terminology reuse with copying
